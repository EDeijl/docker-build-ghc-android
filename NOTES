NOTES

Notes for my blog post

Things Docker does right!
- When you modify a script that is run Docker realises it is different
  and will rewind its state back to the point where the ADD command for that
  script occurred and then re-run from there. This is important!

- Put all the long running, annoying, downloads at the beginning.

- Add lots of little script files.
- Add script files ONE AT A TIME. This way if you have add a new one then
  it won't force a rebuild.
